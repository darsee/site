# seamusdarcy.com

This is my personal site.

I've been meaning to do this for years, but never got around to it... I came across [muan.co](http://muan.co), which was so nice that it compelled me into action, so this is forked from https://github.com/muan/site.

## Scripts

* `npm install`: Install github-pages
* `npm start`: Run the jekyll server
* `npm run start-drafts`: Include posts in the '_drafts' folder
* `npm run deploy`: Deploy the site to seamusdarcy.com
