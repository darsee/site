This is my personal site.

I've been meaning to do this for years, but never got around to it... I came across [muan.co](http://muan.co), which was so nice that it compelled me into action, so this is forked from https://github.com/muan/site.

## Compile

```bash
$ gem install github-pages
# add --drafts to see posts from /_drafts
$ jekyll server -w --baseurl=''
```
